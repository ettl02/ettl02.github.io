This journey so far has been a whirlwind. I have been through some ups and downs, mostly downs but have stayed the course with grit (and git). As I have been trying to keep up with the material, I have been struggling to decide on a topic for this blog post. With the theme of going through a rollercoaster of emotions and the feeling of total mind-blowing material, maybe I’ll discuss something that really made the rollercoaster ride slow down for me. I came across the section of HTML and CSS a week or so ago and it stuck with me. So far, I have been doing Procedural Ruby, then curriculum took a step back and briefly introduced some front-end languages. 

Here is a brief break-down of what I took from it:

HTML is a language of the web and stands for hypertext markup language. The content part are the words you write that make up the website, and the markup, is the language you use to communicate to the computer that you want those words displayed in a certain, structured way. HTML documents are published by web servers then through the magic of HTTP, the web browsers open those documents and read ‘em! The inventors of HTML were brilliant people. They built a language that enables ANYONE to create ANYTHING on the internet. Like Flatiron puts it, “This is what makes the web and internet magical.”

Now, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets comes into play. CSS is essentially the look and feel of the website. It takes over the words and presents it in an attractive way from the rigid structured lines of HTML. Elements such as font family, font color, font size, line height, and letter spacing are just a small sample of the creative liberties CSS allows. The options are endless. 

This front-end development speaks to me. It’s the blank canvas of coding that requires no rules or specific formula. I am a creative spirit through and through. I see things right-brained and dive into projects with that quirky creative mentality (which probably puts me at a disadvantage on the back-end of things). With HTML and CSS, I thrive. It enables me to envision and execute the picture in my head on the screen. The code comes to life. 

This coding stuff is hard. No sugar coating here. This why they call it boot camp. Amongst the endless nights staring at a screen, racking my brain over these languages I’m learning, I get excited when I go through a lesson that ignites my passion for this all over again. CSS and HTML proved to be a refreshing break from the back-end. Those little glimmers of confidence keep me going. Am I going to continue to struggle every day? You bet. But will I give up? No way.
